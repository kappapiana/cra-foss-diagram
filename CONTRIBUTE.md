# How To Contribute

The Diagram is a `drawio` file, it is easily changed with draw.io, an online Open Source app. There are several ways to use the app.

Requires kowledge of `git` and how to open a pull request in `github`

## Online via Github if you do not have access

1. Fork the repo to your account, create new branch
2. Go to <https://app.diagrams.net/>
3. Select Github as the source
4. Open existing diagram from the forked repo
5. Edit it as you please
6. Save with a meaningful message
7. Open a pull request from the new branch against the main branch in original repo

Note: app's access to Github must be authorized if not already.

## Offline

Same as above, but clone the forked repo locally. No need to authorize the app in Github.

1. Clone, create new branch
2. Open from "Device"
3. Change & Save locally
4. Push to repository
5. Open a pull request from forked new branch to original repo

## In VScode/Codium

Same as Offline, but the edit can be done locally by installing a draw.io extension in vscode/codium.
